# Accurent Housing App!
Accurent was an app created for the zipCode hackathon. It was envisioned as a way to help match renters and rentees based on price range compatibility. Helping both parties involved reduce the time spent in finding the perfect house by providing a compatibility score based on a variety of factors.
