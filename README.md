# simple-node-webapp
Simple Webapp using Express, React, Babel, and Webpack. Meant to be used as super-simplistic boilerplate for experimenting and stuff.

... I should probably mention that it's isomorphic as well.

## How to run
Pull/Download repository

```Not quite sure what git command will do this for you```

Running the app

```$ npm run local```
